    answer:
      "Most adults who are able to provide saliva samples can use the diamed kit. There are no age limitations meaning anyone could, in theory, use diamed's test kit. If you have an active sex life with multiple partners (and practice safer sex), you should get tested every 3 to 6 months. If you enter a monogamous relationship - or actively maintain one - we recommend that both of you get tested before having unprotected sex and repeat this annually.",
